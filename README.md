Hi there, I'm Tanveer Ahmed Shah! 👋
saturncloud.ioA Guide to Convolutional Neural Networks — the ELI5 way | Saturn Cloud Blog
I'm a passionate Machine Learning and Deep Learning enthusiast with a keen interest in applying AI to real-world problems like healthcare, environmental prediction, and image processing. I enjoy building models, experimenting with neural networks, and creating interactive applications. My projects span from classification and clustering tasks to game development and system programming.

🔭 Currently exploring advanced DL architectures like U-Net for image segmentation.
🌱 Learning more about Hugging Face ecosystems and ensemble methods.
💬 Ask me about ML algorithms, Python/OpenGL projects, or C-based system tools.
📫 Reach me via GitHub or connect on LinkedIn (add your link if available).
⚡ Fun fact: I love blending graphics with AI—check out my 3D arcade shooters!
